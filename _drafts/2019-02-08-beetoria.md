title: "Beetoria"
---

I picked up our farm share one week to discover a large variety of
beets. We had been trying to incorporate more vegetables into our
diet, and a vegetable cannon of a farm share seemed like an effective
way to ensure that. I was made a large beet pie, and ate the whole
thing in just a few days. At work the following day, I noticed a dark
red in my urine. Returning to my desk ashen, I convinced a friend to
drive me to the hospital. There, I learned what you'd expect: beets
dye _everything_ red.
