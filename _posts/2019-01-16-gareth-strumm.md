title: Gareth Strumm

Gareth Strumm is as thin as he is tall, towering over most. He has a
dark complexion and an intense glare that seems to pierce through
you. Those that dare to get close to him notice a faint musky aroma
that is not entirely unpleasant.

He is not a silent man, his footsteps announce his presence long
before he enters a room. Those who know him have learned to secure
anything delicate, lest it be shook free by the vibrations.

His voice, though, belies his appearance. Higher than you would
expect, it is perhaps his most disarming feature. A voice almost
melodious, it lulls you into revealing more than you intend.
