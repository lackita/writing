title: "The Decision"

Drelia advances a piece, capturing one of her opponent Mirielle's
pieces.

"You can always resign, there's no shame in remaining a Fifth Degree
Weaver." Drelia says as she removes a piece from the board.

"So confident, did it ever occur to you I wanted you to take that
piece?"

"Be careful what you sacrifice."

Mirielle begins executing her plan, as pieces are exchanged a mistake
becomes apparent. Needing a change in perspective, she weaves together
two threads of magic: Freedom and Infinity. Freeing her mind of
inhibitions, she begins looking at the game in ever broadening levels.

Accepting Mirielle's invitation to involve magic, Drelia pulls out a
small bone; breaking it in half, a mist grows to envelop
Mirielle. Distracted, she accidentally inhales the vapor and
immediately begins to feel nauseous.

Ignoring the pain as her very bones become poisonous, she turns her
attention fully to The Spider's Game. Finally seeing a path to
victory, there is a quick exchange as they confidently move into the
endgame.

"You know, the only way you're getting an antidote is if I win."
Drelia says, beginning to realize the end is near.

"Death is a small price to pay to achieve ones goals." Mirielle
boasts, sealing her victory.

Falling to the ground, she succumbs to the poison. As her ghost floats
above her body, she begins to feel the satisfaction of reaching the
pinnacle of her order. Reacquiring a body will be annoying, but she'll
do so as a Weaver of the Sixth Degree.
