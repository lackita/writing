        <p>It was a cool and crisp day when four adventurers met by chance at an intersection in a glen outside Waterdeep. In the distance chimed bells sounding much like a distress call, and Luukha convinced this unlikely group to investigate.</p>

<p>The party finds the town of Nightstone largely abandoned by its inhabitants, and the large stone which served as a centerpiece was mysteriously missing. Strewn about are several boulders, seeming to have caused a significant amount of damage to some of the buildings.</p>

<p>By a temple to Milekki they encountered some Wargs, and inside they encounter some difficulty. After cutting the rope pulling the bell, the weight crashes through nearly flattening Cade.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the stable, Malxiris is ambushed by a goblin. In her surprise she unleashes her formidable breath and sets the building aflame. Fortunately, with the assistance of Luukha and Gruebound, they were able to rescue the horses tied up inside.</p>

<p>Cade, on the other hand, is having none of these shenanigans and instead visits the nearby Inn. He learns from a monk named Kella that the villagers had been taken to a nearby cave by goblins, and the scattered boulders seemed almost as if they had been dropped.</p>

<p>At this point, our adventurers chose to split up. Malxiris and Luukha explored some of the houses, while Cade and Gruebound visited the graveyard. Malxiris tamed a Tressom at Xelbrin’s, which she named Hanoos. They also visited the homes of Aganor and Somerhawk, but found very little of note. Grue was very interested opening the crypt, but lacked the tools to accomplish his goal.</p>

<p>While Grue struggled fruitlessly against the sealed crypt, Cade joined Malxiris and Luukha in looting the general store. The goblin inside was quickly dispatched, and by the time Grue joined them the action had ended. Luukha begrudgingly shared her crowbar with him, and ultimately assisted in pointlessly defiling the Nandar crypt.</p>

<p>Having explored the town, they chose to visit the nearby Keep before investigating the cave where the villagers were held. The guards fortified within were charmed by the party, sharing that the boulders came from Sky Castle. Gruebound’s curiosity and lack of tact proved problematic, though, and after being assaulted by a magical sword he causes enough noise to draw the attention of two guards. He disguises himself as one of them, but chose a face that is unrecognizable to them.</p>

<p>How will he escape? Will the villagers be rescued from the goblins? What is Sky Castle and why is it dropping rocks on Nightstone?</p>
