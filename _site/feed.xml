My memory of it is
faded, but I focus and remember a spell memorized years before. The
techniques I learned prior to Shadow have served me well, and the
spell I had been holding in my head for so long is still strong and
clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A glow rings my head, establishing a connection to the Blue Sun and
revealing the thread I must follow. The path is long and dangerous,
but that journey pales compared to the prospect of homelessness. It
twists and winds its way around my head, eventually leading to the
desired memory caged within the tendrils of a Memory Kraken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could pull it away, burn it into oblivion, that is within my power.
Maybe the stick isn’t a good choice, though, perhaps the carrot would
be more effective; I gather mundane memories I can offer to gain its
trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hold in my hand fragments of little importance: tying my shoes,
brushing my teeth, anything routine or mundane. Pulling them apart and
spreading them around the filthy tendrils causes them to loosen their
grip, its hunger temporarily sated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What memory should I offer in its place? Everything seems so precious,
then it hits me: I can trick it into feeding on itself. Of all the
thoughts in my head, the one I’m creating right now is singularly
unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coax the beast toward that morsel, and it reaches out eagerly. This
is a crucial point, I must move on before its grip tightens and traps
me as well. I see a large opening, realize there are mere seconds
until it is enveloped, and I dive through…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, what were we talking about? I really don’t have time to
chat, you see I’ve only just remembered where I live and I’d very much
like to get home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It has been so long since I’ve seen my house.

In the distance chimed bells sounding much like a distress call, and Luukha convinced this unlikely group to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party finds the town of Nightstone largely abandoned by its inhabitants, and the large stone which served as a centerpiece was mysteriously missing. Strewn about are several boulders, seeming to have caused a significant amount of damage to some of the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a temple to Milekki they encountered some Wargs, and inside they encounter some difficulty. After cutting the rope pulling the bell, the weight crashes through nearly flattening Cade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, in the stable, Malxiris is ambushed by a goblin. In her surprise she unleashes her formidable breath and sets the building aflame. Fortunately, with the assistance of Luukha and Gruebound, they were able to rescue the horses tied up inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cade, on the other hand, is having none of these shenanigans and instead visits the nearby Inn. He learns from a monk named Kella that the villagers had been taken to a nearby cave by goblins, and the scattered boulders seemed almost as if they had been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, our adventurers chose to split up. Malxiris and Luukha explored some of the houses, while Cade and Gruebound visited the graveyard. Malxiris tamed a Tressom at Xelbrin’s, which she named Hanoos. They also visited the homes of Aganor and Somerhawk, but found very little of note. Grue was very interested opening the crypt, but lacked the tools to accomplish his goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Grue struggled fruitlessly against the sealed crypt, Cade joined Malxiris and Luukha in looting the general store. The goblin inside was quickly dispatched, and by the time Grue joined them the action had ended. Luukha begrudgingly shared her crowbar with him, and ultimately assisted in pointlessly defiling the Nandar crypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having explored the town, they chose to visit the nearby Keep before investigating the cave where the villagers were held. The guards fortified within were charmed by the party, sharing that the boulders came from Sky Castle. Gruebound’s curiosity and lack of tact proved problematic, though, and after being assaulted by a magical sword he causes enough noise to draw the attention of two guards. He disguises himself as one of them, but chose a face that is unrecognizable to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will he escape? Will the villagers be rescued from the goblins? What is Sky Castle and why is it dropping rocks on Nightstone?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It was a cool and crisp day when four adventurers met by chance at an intersection in a glen outside Waterdeep.
