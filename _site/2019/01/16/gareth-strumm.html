	<h3>Gareth Strumm</h3>
        <p>Gareth Strumm is as thin as he is tall, towering over most. He has a
dark complexion and an intense glare that seems to pierce through
you. Those that dare to get close to him notice a faint musky aroma
that is not entirely unpleasant.</p>

<p>He is not a silent man, his footsteps announce his presence long
before he enters a room. Those who know him have learned to secure
anything delicate, lest it be shook free by the vibrations.</p>

<p>His voice, though, belies his appearance. Higher than you would
expect, it is perhaps his most disarming feature. A voice almost
melodious, it lulls you into revealing more than you intend.</p>
